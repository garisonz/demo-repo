# demo-repo

Demo for my introduction to Github.


## Informative

In Visual Studio Code:

; Opened a folder named Git

; In the terminal bring repository from github to Git folder using "git clone URL" 

; Modified README.md and created index.html in demo-repo

; To commit both files, use "git add ." to track files

; Commit using "git commit -m 'Added index.html' -m 'some description'"

; To make commit live on github use "git push"
